```"This is the new bed from Wobbly Dream Inc."
"The "Sleepy Sleeper 3000"."
"It features the latest in bed technology."
"It "Makes all your dreams come true"."
"Why not give it a try!"
"Why not give it a try!"
"You must really like this bed!"
"Yes, I know I'm a talking sofa. "
"But we don't have time to go into that now."
"I need your help."
"Come outside and I'll show you why."
"Where Wobbly's dreams are made."
"But Dreamland is under a great threat."
"The Sleep King has forgotten to set his alarm clock..."
"...and so night time is lasting forever."
"I need you to go to his castle and wake him up!"
"This path should take you there."
"Come on! There is no time to waste. "
"Night time isn't supposed to last this long..."
"Who knows what could happen if we don't wake him soon."
"He's forgotten to set his alarm clock..."
"...and so night time is lasting forever."
"He'll be in his castle. "
"This path should take you there."
"All the dreams are starting to behave strangely."
"Did I hear you say you wanted to get across here?"
"There did used to be a bridge."
"But a crazy dream involving a giant egg knocked it down."
"I've been trying to fix it. But I don't have any ideas how to do it."
"If you can get me some ideas I'm sure I could build it in no time."
"The Wobbly's around here will probably have some."
"You can never have enough rubber ducks in a bath."
"And they come in lots of different colors!"
"When I was 10 I ate 7 burgers all by myself!"
"I bet I could eat even more now I'm grown up!"
"I can play two notes at once on this piano."
"See!"
"One for each hand."
"They are the only way to get around."
"No waiting for traffic, loop the loops."
"I rest my case."
"Yes! I can definitely make some of the bridge out of burgers."
"Of course, a Grand Piano will make a nice long section."
"I remember now! Planes make amazing bridges."
"Those were some great ideas, thanks!"
"The castle's this way."
"We need get to the castle and wake the Sleep King before something really odd happens."
"Lets go."
"..."
"Wait..."
"So keep doing it!"
"We'll be onto the next cloud in no time."
"Looks like this door is working now."
"Let's go!"
"He wasn't there before."
"Things are getting serious."
"There is no time to lose."
"Try jumping on those clouds!"
"Try jumping on those clouds!"
"Not far to go now."
"Head to the castle!"
"Not far to go now."
"The Sleep King must be upstairs."
"Everytime you climb the stairs the Sleep King's power is sending you to sleep."
"We need to find some way of keeping you awake while you climb up."
"Hmmmmm."
"I was having the best dream..."
"What?"
"Oh no!"
"It's still night time!"
"I must make it day immediately."
"Dreams can only rest in the daytime."
"Let me see..."
"The dreams have settled down now."
"Thank you small Wobbly, you've helped save Dreamland. "
"You must take this as a reward. I hope you find it useful."
"Sorting all that out wasn't half tiring."
"I knew you would. "
"It's good to see everything back to normal."
"Well... normal for Dreamland anyway."
"Thank you, I'm proud to be your sofa!"
"Something weird is happening here."
"And it's stopping us getting through that door to the next cloud."
"I can't quite work it out, but things seem all muddled!"
"...the dreams are starting to behave strangely."
"There used to be a bridge here."
"There must be a way to rebuild it."
"Oh hello."
"Are you ready for the best sleep of your life?"
"This is our "Sleepy Sleeper 3000"."
"Wow that was a big sleep."
"Hello there."
"Welcome to Dreamland."
"You need to go wake the Sleep King."
"I need ideas to build this bridge."
"Someone around here must have some."
"I was just thinking about rubber ducks."
"Can I tell you a story?"
"Hey come watch me play."
"The only thing I want to talk about is planes."
"A duck! That will make a great first section."
"Wow, I think this bridge is even better than the last one!"
"Right. Let's get going."
"Time is running out. "
"Great, you made it!"
"Whatever you are doing is working."
"That's it! "
"Interesting..."
"We've got to get going."
"You made it!"
"You made it to the castle! Well done!"
"Get up there and wake up the Sleep King!"
"Oh dear."
"Huh?"
"That's better."
"You did it!"
"Oh no. I can't help you get across!"
"Something weird is happening here."
"And it's stopping us getting through to the next cloud."
"I can't quite work it out, but things seem all muddled!"
"Those were some great ideas, thanks!"
"Hey look, a magic carpet!"
"We can use this to get to the next cloud."
"Woah there tiny Wobbly."
"You need an invitation to see the Sleep King."
"Show us an invitation and we'll let you cross the bridge."
"You need an invitation to see the Sleep King."
"Show us an invitation and we'll let you cross the bridge."
"An invitation!"
"You must be an important Wobbly."
"Lower the bridge."
"They should take you to the castle, I'll meet you there."
"They should take you to the castle, I'll meet you there."
"Stop there!"
"You can't come through without an invitation."
"This bed sure is comfy!"
"It's like sleeping on a cloud."
"Go and wake him up!"
"Look over there."
"That's the Sleep King's alarm clock."
"If that's down here no wonder he hasn't woken up."
"I bet that'll keep you awake while you climb the stairs."
"You can use keys like this one to wind it up."
"Watch out though, you'll need to find more keys on your way up to keep it going."
"Right off you go, there is no time to lose!"
"We need to find some way of keeping you awake while you climb up."
"Look over there."
"That's the Sleep King's alarm clock."
"It will keep you awake while you climb the stairs."
"You can use keys like this one to wind it up."
"Watch out though, you'll need to find more keys on your way up to keep it going."
"Right off you go, there is no time to lose!"
"Oh Margaret, where are you?"
"A car came through this here field."
"And hit poor Margaret into the air."
"She flew that way out over the ocean."
"Can you see if you can find her?"
"I'm awful worried."
"Margaret!"
"I thought I'd never see you again."
"What a good cow."
"Thank you so much!"
"I'm not letting her out of my sight again."
"Can you help me find my binoculars?"
"I dropped them into the river and the current washed them away."
"I have no idea where they are now."
"Brian won't be happy if I've lost them."
"This is my second pair this week."
"You found them!"
"Thank goodness, I would have been in so much trouble."
"You're quite the explorer!"
"Binoculars sure are neat."
"They allow me to study all sorts of insects without disturbing them."
"Hey, nice to meet you."
"I'm Leeroy, one of the three Bobble Brothers."
"I'm the clever one. "
"Well usually..."
"We mixed up our bags on the way to work."
"I'm supposed to have a first aid kit..."
"But I've got Bob's wrench instead."
"If you could swap them back that would be great!"
"My brothers get the underground train to work too."
"So they shouldn't be far away."
"My two brothers and I mixed up our bags on the way to work."
"I'm supposed to have a first aid kit..."
"But I've got Bob's wrench instead."
"If you could swap them back that would be great!"
"My brothers get the underground train to work too."
"So they shouldn't be far away."
"My first aid kit!"
"Thank you, now I can get to work."
"Thanks for my first aid kit."
"But I've still got Bob's wrench."
"Can you get it to him?"
"Thanks for getting Bob his wrench."
"Any luck finding my first aid kit?"
"Thanks for returning all my brothers stuff!"
"You're one kind Wobbly."
"My names Bob."
"You may have met one of my brothers, Leeroy and Marvin."
"They call us the Bobble Brothers."
"Though I'm the only one with any sense."
"You see my brothers both took the wrong bags to work."
"And they left me with Marvin's duck. Silly thing."
"If you could give Marvin his duck back and find my wrench I'd really appreciate it."
"Both my brothers should be at one of the underground stations."
"My brothers took the wrongs bags to work."
"And I got left with Marvin's duck."
"If you could give Marvin his duck back and find my wrench it would really help me out."
"You found my wrench."
"Thanks buddy."
"Thanks for the wrench..."
"But I've still got Marvin's silly duck."
"Can you take it to him?"
"You found Marvin, that's good."
"He wasn't messing around was he?"
"Also any sign of my wrench?"
"Either Marvin or Leeroy must have it."
"You've returned everyone's stuff?"
"Good work, I wish my brothers were more like you."
"Hey dude."
"I'm Marvin. The best of the Bobble Brothers."
"You haven't seen my duck have you?"
"I can't lifeguard without it!"
"One of my less cool brothers must have taken it."
"I've got Leeroy's first aid kit."
"Ain't no way I'm gonna need that at the pool!"
"If you can find my duck and give Leeroy his first aid kit that would be rad."
"We all get the underground train to work, so they gotta be around here somewhere!"
"Hey, if you can find my duck that would be rad."
"One of my less cool brothers must have taken it to work with them."
"I can't be an awesome life guard without it!"
"I guess if you could take Leeroy's first aid kit to him that'd be cool too."
"My dude.... you found Ducky."
"Man that's awesome, thank you!"
"That's mega that you got Ducky back."
"I've still got Leeroy's first aid kit."
"Any chance you can get it back to him?"
"Woah you got Leeroy's first aid kit back to him, that's chill!"
"You didn't happen to find my duck yet?"
"Wait... you got both my bro's stuff back."
"What a mega awesome job."
"The Bobble Bro's thank you."
"My first aid kit!"
"Thank you, now I can get to work."
"I'm Leeroy, one of the three Bobble Brothers."
"I'm the clever one. "
"Well usually... we all mixed up our bags this morning."
"Thanks for getting me my first aid kit."
"I've still got Bobs wrench."
"Can you get it to him?"
"You found my wrench."
"Thanks buddy."
"My names Bob."
"You may have met one of my brothers, Leeroy and Marvin."
"They call us the Bobble Brothers."
"Though I'm the only one with any sense."
"You see my brothers both took the wrong bags to work."
"And they left me with Marvin's duck. Silly thing."
"Can you give Marvin his duck back?"
"My dude.... you found Ducky."
"Man that's awesome, thank you!"
"I'm Marvin. The best of the Bobble Brothers."
"One of my less cool brothers must have taken Ducky."
"Thanks for returning him."
"I've got Leeroy's first aid kit."
"Ain't no way I'm gonna need that at the pool!"
"Can you give it back to him?"
"Right, let's get you started."
"Get up off the floor."
"Great, now look around."
"Very good, now walk around a bit."
"Perfect. Now let's get you your first job."
"Lets go talk to this Wobbly."
"Wobbly's with a <size=150%><b><color=#FFD800>!</color></b></size> above their heads have a job for you."
"Go and talk to the Wobbly across the road."
"This is a job sheet."
"It will show you what you need to do to complete a job."
"Doing jobs earns you money."
"Every job is different, lots of them have a time limit so be as quick as you can!"
"This job is to collect some Jelly from the Mall."
"The arrow will show you where you need to go to get the Jelly."
"Look, the Jelly is over there!"
"Raise your arms with <action=LeftArmGrab> and <action=RightArmGrab>, and hold them out to pick up objects."
"When you press <action=LeftArmGrab> or <action=RightArmGrab> your arms will grab the nearest object."
"Try picking up the Jelly."
"Well done! Let's put the Jelly in the back of this car."
"You can use your arms to hit buttons."
"Hit the button to open and close the back of the vehicle."
"Now put the Jelly in the back of the vehicle."
"Good job, now we better close the back of the vehicle."
"Perfect, now we can drive the car back and deliver the Jelly."
"Press <action=ActionEnterExitInteract> to get in car."
"Now we just need to deliver the Jelly to the Jelly man."
"Put the Jelly in the yellow marker to complete the job."
"Thanks for the Jelly!"
"As a reward you can have this Jelly Hat."
"You should go try the hat on."
"Wait, before you do that, you should put your money in the bank."
"ATMs are located all over Wobbly Island."
"Deposit your money in the ATM to keep it safe."
"Well done. Now be a good Wobbly and go try on your new hat."
"You can change clothes by using wardrobes. There is a wardrobe in your bedroom."
"Once you're done, come back outside and show off your new hat."
"That hat looks great!"
"What a nice man."
"Now let's take a look at your minimap."
"There are different jobs all over the island."
"Follow the job icons on the map to find them."
"This symbol marks where you can deposit your money to keep it safe at a Bank or ATM."
"You can use your money to buy clothes, pets and vehicles at shops all over the island."
"If you earn enough money you can even buy your own house."
"Houses are located all over the island and can be bought by using the "For Sale" sign outside them."
"For a more detailed view you can access a full screen map by pressing <action=Map>."
"I think you've learnt enough."
"Go out there and make your Grandma proud!"
"When sparks hit ground."
"Dark clouds all around."
"Treasure here will rise."
"An ancient magical prize."
"But yours it is not."
"It belongs to one that time forgot."
"Return it to him."
"And more riches you will win."
"If you find them all I just might let you test the UFO out."
"I've put what I need on the whiteboard behind me."
"They were supposed to be delivered hours ago."
"But I'm missing some important parts."
"I'm trying to fix this UFO."
"Hold on, maybe you could be useful."
"This is a secret base. Let me escort you out!"
"Hey, you're not supposed to be here."
"Find them as soon as you can."
"I'm worried I might squash someone."
"You found the keys. You're the best!"
"Hey, over here!"
"You look different to the others."
"Maybe you can help."
"I'm having a bit of trouble finding my team."
"If you could find them all, that would be amazing."
"I've drawn their pictures on this notepad."
"I'll stay here in case anyone else comes down."
"Keep looking, I'm counting on you."
"Thanks for finding everyone!"
"We should really be more careful down here."
"You've found me all the way up here!"
"My plan was to get up high to search for the keys."
"But then I remembered I was scared of heights."
"So I got stuck here."
"I did see something happening over by the lazers though."
"I'm sure someone will be along soon to help me down."
"Good job finding everyone!"
"Thanks for finding me."
"All those lazers are scary!"
"I got distracted by this big fish."
"Not seen the keys yet, they must be around somewhere."
"I'll just hang out here with my new fish friend..."
"And keep looking for the keys."
"It's great that with my help the keys have all been found."
"You've found me!"
"My friend is stuck up on that ledge."
"If only I could get that robotic arm to work."
"Then I could get to him."
"It's got something to do with this computer I think."
"I knew this expedition was a bad idea."
"Well done for finding the whole team."
"Thank you so much for finding me!"
"I found the keys, but then couldn't get back down."
"You should take them back to the UFO scientist."
"He'll know what to do."
"Once you've found everyone take the keys back to the UFO."
"I'm so happy this expedition has been a success!"
"Keep looking for those parts, they must be somewhere."
"Amazing, you can just feel the power in this thing."
"Those lab scientists are always losing things."
"I'm so glad you were there to help them out."
"Great! Someone finally managed to create the correct fuel formula."
"This is a very important breakthrough."
"Brilliant, I know exactly where to put this fuse."
"That's all the parts I need!"
"How exciting! As a reward you can have the first test."
"Use this terminal to start the test flight."
"I couldn't have done it without you, you're a true scientist!"
"Well this is unexpected!"
"This is not the time for crazy experiments!"
"We need to use the formula on the whiteboard."
"Oh where has she gone!"
"I only turned my back for a second."
"Please help me find my daughter."
"She must be somewhere in this lab."
"I'm sure I can knit something nice for you if you find her."
"Thank you so much for finding her! "
"While you were gone I made you this jumper."
"You are very kind for a Wobbly."
"You're always welcome here."
"Hey you..."
"Listen here..."
"Keep quiet... they might be listening."
"Weird things keep happening around this mountain."
"It must be aliens!"
"I just need some proof."
"If you find anything, bring it here first..."
"...and don't tell anyone!"
"You won't regret it."
"I knew it!"
"This is the proof I need."
"Well done young Wobbly."
"As a thank you, have one of my radar blocking helmets."
"It helps stop them listening in."
"I bet there's more secrets down there."
"More stuff that they're hiding."
"Hey, welcome to the Wobbly Museum."
"This museum contains Artifacts from Wobbly history."
"Well....... it usually does."
"We have somehow misplaced most of our Artifacts,"
"if you find any Artifacts be sure to bring them here."
"Help us recover our Artifact collections,"
"and we might even reward you."
"An Artifact in the wild looks like this."
"As you can see, they have a distinctive glow."
"Some Artifact exhibits have clues about where to find them."
"So make sure you have a good look around."
"Good luck young Wobbly."
"Artifacts can be found all over the place."
"The maps sold by Treasure Hunters might be a good place to start."
"Though I doubt you can find all of them that way."
"Some Artifact exhibits have clues about where to find them."
"So make sure you have a good look around."
"You've found an Artifact!"
"Well done, we don't have this Artifact yet."
"What a great Artifact, in such good condition."
"An Artifact for the museum!"
"I'm afraid we already have that Artifact in the museum."
"Wow, you've completed the Ancient Fossil Collection."
"It's so good to have those old rocks back."
"That's the last Artifact in the Dinosaur Fossil collection!"
"You sure are good at collecting Artifacts."
"That's the last bone we need for the Wobblysaurus-Rex."
"It's so good to see it complete again."
"Wait, that's the last Artifact we need for the Early Wobbly collection."
"We'll make an archaeologist of you yet!"
"Amazing, that's the last Artifact in the Jungle collection."
"Those ancient Wobbly tribes are fascinating."
"This completes the Gold collection, thank you so much!"
"These Artifacts are some of the rarest treasures we have."
"Good job, you've completed the Treasure collection."
"It really is starting to feel like a proper museum again."
"Good work, that's the Paradise Island collection complete!"
"You've definitely earned yourself a trip to the beach!"
"You really like exploring caves don't you!"
"That's the last Artifact we need for Cave Collection!"
"Wow, you really have been busy fishing!"
"This artifact completes the Ocean Collection."
"You really braved the cold on this one. Well done!"
"That's all the artifacts we need for the Ice Cave Collection!"
"Blarb Blobun Dum Dom Wob Blabba"
"Blubben Blop Dewey Dob Blarb Bobo"
"Womba Dum Dob Blabo Blop Wubba"
"Oh no! The base has caught fire."
"I'm so glad you're here Private."
"In this hangar are some Water Cannon Tanks."
"We've been developing them for the Wobbly Fire Department."
"Quick, get in one and put out those fires!"
"Hi there Private."
"I'm the Fire Marshal for this base. "
"It sure does get hot here sometimes."
"Hey! You found me."
"I like it down here..."
"... no one hits me with a club."
"Feel free to come by and hang out any time."
"Oh, you're interested in having a look around the observatory?"
"Well my Wobbly friend, this is a place of science..."
"... so if you want to look around you'll have to make yourself useful."
"We've been discovering audio signals through our telescopes."
"And we're not quite sure what they mean."
"We think it must be some form of Alien code."
"There are four telescopes around Wobbly Island."
"And each one of them seems to receive a different audio signal."
"Locate the signal from each of the telescopes... "
"... and use these terminals to enter any data you find."
"You will need a clear starry night to find the signals."
"And remember..."
"Keep your eyes on the skies!"
"How are you doing with solving the code?"
"Remember, we've heard one audio signal..."
"... through each of the 4 telescopes on the island."
"You will need a clear starry night to find the signals."
"Use these terminals to enter any data you find."
"The signals must mean something!"
"Go forth in the name of science!"
"Wow, you've solved the puzzle."
"Wait..."
"These four numbers are Wobbly coordinates!"
"They point to a specific place on Wobbly Island."
"Go here and see what you can discover."
"Make sure to bring anything you find back here!"
"What are you waiting for!"
"Go and search the location of the coordinates."
"Make sure to bring whatever you find back here!"
"What have you found!"
"These look like anti-gravity Moon Boots."
"They must have fallen down from an Alien spaceship."
"And the Aliens have been trying to tell us where to find them!"
"What a good day for science!"
"How are those Moon Boots treating you?"
"They look super useful."
"LOST: Key to the trophy cabinet."
"Last seen on the Mansion Island."
"Hey, come help me with these taxi fares!"
"Ah, good timing!"
"You look like a Wobbly who can handle themselves."
"I'm Steve and I'm in charge of this expedition."
"I can't work out how to open this door!"
"But I think you can help."
"I've been busy translating these wall carvings."
"They say there are four scrolls hidden in caves across the islands."
"These scrolls must show us how to get inside!"
"I think these four symbols represent each of the caves."
"Look out for stone chests like this."
"The scrolls should be inside them."
"You can open them with this key!"
"If you find all the scrolls, I'll let you be my assistant."
"And we can explore what's behind the door together!"
"Remember I need four scrolls."
"Each from a different cave across the island."
"Use these symbols to work out which caves you need to explore."
"Good work! You found one of the scrolls we need!"
"A scroll! Keep up the good work."
"Yes, a scroll! One step closer to finding the answer!"
"More than one scroll! We'll have that door open in no time!"
"That's all the scrolls!"
"Wait, if I read them all together..."
"... they say that this door leads to the 'Ancient Wobbly Trials'."
"But to enter the trials we need one last item."
"A hat of some kind."
"According to this it can be found in a secret cave... "
"... near the giant Wobbly statue right here in the Jungle!"
"I'll mark the location on your map."
"Before we can open this door we need one last item."
"A hat which is hidden in a cave..."
"... near the giant Wobbly statue right here in the Jungle!"
"I've marked its location on your map."
"What are you waiting for?"
"... let's get down there!"
"Master the ancient board."
"And lay claim to your reward."
"You have proven worthy of the Wobbly Trials."
"Our technology shall be your reward. "
"That was intense!"
"Those ancient Wobblies sure were a clever bunch."
"Though I wonder what these trials were used for..."
"..."
"Anyway... I'm going to stay here and continue to study the trials."
"There is another trial door nearby which has now lit up."
"I think it's another way down to the hoverboard race, I'll mark it on your map."
"Thank you for your help."
"Thanks for helping me complete the trials!"
"I'll make sure to mention you in my report."
"What brings you down here young Wobbly?"
"You were sent here by Steve to find an ancient hat."
"Didn't we find something like that?"
"..."
"Oh stop messing around and take it off!"
"Here you go, take it with you."
"But be careful, the only way out is past that whirlpool up the path."
"Didn't expect to see anyone else down here!"
"Be careful, this place is dangerous!"
"Oh, so you found a use for that hat."
"It did what!? Well then I'm glad you took it!"
"That all sounds a bit too much excitement for me!"
"This chest is locked."
"You found a scroll, the archaeologist in the Jungle would like to see this."
"You've found all the scrolls! You should go visit the archaeologist in the Jungle."
"You've already found the scroll in this chest and delivered it to the archaeologist."
"You've already found the scroll in this chest and delivered it to the archaeologist."
"You've already found this scroll, but haven't delivered it to archaeologist yet!"
"Woah man."
"Your moves are unreal!"
"Impressive!"
"You pull some awesome shapes Wobbly friend."
"Totally awesome moves!"
"You owned that dance floor."
"Ouch..."
"I think you need a bit more practice dude."
"My poor ears!"
"That wasn't good enough Wobbly friend."
"Not cool man..."
"You need to learn some better moves!"
"Hey Wobbly friend."
"You gotta hear my new track, it's totally rad!"
"There's cash prizes for the best dancers!"
"Woah, don't distract me while I'm DJing!"
"Wow, you've caught every fish!"
"Come visit me at the Wobbly Marina, I've got a surprise for you."
"I'll mark where I am on your map."
"Whatever the question, fishing is always the answer."
"You should have a look at the Fish Book."
"It shows you all the fish you can catch and where to find them."
"You can find a Fish Book in any of the fishing huts."
"If you catch all the different types of fish, come visit me!"
"Hey! Us fishing folk have been keeping an eye on you."
"You've proved yourself one of the best fishers on the whole island!"
"Plus your work has done so much to help our research."
"As a reward I'd like to give you my Super Yacht."
"Use this chart when you want to sail it."
"May it serve you well on many new fishing adventures!"
"How's that Super Yacht treating you?"
"It sure is a nice boat!"
"This door is locked."
"What are you doing down here!"
"Ah, you found my spare basement key."
"I always knew you were a clever one."
"So..."
"Do you like jelly?"
"Because I've been working on a very secret project."
"I'm creating the first ever JELLY CAR!"
"I know! It's so exciting!"
"I've kept it a secret as I didn't want the technology to fall into the wrong hands."
"Now all that's left to do is assemble it."
"The first step is to put on the four jelly wheels."
"Now where did I put them... can you help an old man out and find them for me? "
"They should be around this cave somewhere. They look like this."
"We need to find the four jelly wheels, and put them on the car."
"The wheels look like this. They should be somewhere around this cave..."
"You found them all! Good work."
"The next job is sorting out the jelly engine."
"Meet me in the lab."
"You can find it through this door."
"Welcome to my lab, this is where I do my more dangerous jelly experiments."
"We need to make sure that the engine is working properly."
"Press this button to start running the engine test."
"And use these buttons to keep the engine at a steady temperature."
"Give it a go when you're ready."
"We need to test the engine."
"Press this button to start the test."
"You'll need to use these buttons to keep the engine at a steady temperature."
"We need to test the jelly engine."
"Meet me in the lab."
"You can find it through this door."
"Hmmm, let me make some quick adjustments and we can try again."
"That doesn't seem quite right. Let's try again."
"That test wasn't quite long enough. Give it another go!"
"That engine sounds like it's in tip top condition."
"Did you know that it runs entirely on jelly!!"
"Let's head back and put the engine onto the car."
"Good work!"
"Let's head back and put the engine on the car."
"Now the engine is in position, we need to create the jelly body of the car."
"And I only need 5 more jellies to finish it. Can you get them for me?"
"Send them down to the basement using this chute in my house!"
"You should be able to buy some from the Mall."
"Bring me the jellies and we can make the car's body together."
"Can you bring me 5 jellies so we can make the car's body?"
"Use this chute in my house to get them down to the basement."
"Amazing, that's all the jellies I need!"
"Meet me down in the basement and we can get to work!"
"Thanks for getting those jellies. Can you do one last thing for me?"
"To get the jellies into the machine we need to take them from the chute..."
"... and load them onto this conveyor belt."
"We nearly have enough jelly in the vats..."
"... and these jellies should be enough to fill them to the brim!"
"Thanks for finding the jelly for me."
"To get the jellies into the machine we need to take them from the chute..."
"... and put them onto this conveyer belt to fill up the machine."
"Good job! We're nearly there now."
"Press this button on the machine to create the car's body!"
"We're nearly there now."
"Just press this button on the machine to create the car's body!"
"Wow..."
"Isn't it magnificent!"
"It's better than I ever imagined it could be."
"But wait..."
"It's missing something."
"Where is the steering wheel?"
"It's no good having a jelly car if you can't turn it round corners."
"Oh there it is! It must have bounced up there on a pile of jelly."
"Oh no! It's getting away!"
"You'll have to go in and find it!"
"But be careful in there, that room is still under construction."
"We're so close! We just need the steering wheel."
"It went through that conveyer belt."
"You'll have to go in and find it!"
"But be careful in there, that room is still under construction."
"I'm so happy with my Jelly Car."
"Thank you so much for helping me with it."
"You can take it out for a drive anytime you want."
"Just try not to show it off too much, or everyone will want one!"
"Keep off, it's not ready yet!"
"Hey! Don't drive that in here!"
"Don't go in there, it's too dangerous!"
"Good work!"
"That's a mighty fine house."
"My supervisor says we need to knock this house down and start again."
"We recycle all our building materials, it helps keep costs down."
"Hey, can you help me?"
"I lost my right boot in the sea while I was fishing at the Marina."
"If you can find it for me, I'd be really grateful."
"I don't like any of the shoes they sell here."
"And my foot is getting cold!"
"My lost boot!"
"I thought I would never see it again."
"My right foot thanks you!"
"Take this as a reward for your troubles."
"It's nice to have warm feet again."
"You've got to help me!"
"A seagull has stolen my sandwich!"
"It took it up that hill."
"If you get it for me I'll let you have some."
"I would get it myself but I'm scared of birds..."
"Wow, you sure have a head for heights!"
"Thanks for getting my sandwich."
"As promised, here is your half."
"The seagull ate all the gherkins!"
"Hey Watson, we've got visitors!"
"..."
"Maybe they've come to help us. "
"We're trying to build this raft."
"But Watson's getting desperately thirsty and it's slowing us down."
"You couldn't bring us some water could you?"
"Water! Thank you so much."
"Watson says he's never met a friendlier Wobbly!"
"..."
"He wants me to give you this."
"When Watson and I finish this raft, we're going to sail back home to Wobbly Island."
"..."
"Well I guess I'll just build the raft on my own then..."
"Help! I've lost my bees."
"They can't have gone very far."
"Can you catch them for me?"
"You'll need one of these nets."
"My bees are friendly, so don't worry about getting stung."
"There are still more bees to catch."
"Keep looking!"
"Remember you have to use one of these nets to catch them."
"You've found some of my bees!"
"There must be more nearby."
"Keep looking."
"That's all of them!"
"Thank you so much."
"You'd make a great beekeeper."
"You have definitely earned these."
"Bees make the best friends."
"Aaaahhhh!!!"
"Oh... you're not a monster."
"Sorry, I'm just a little scared."
"I've been working on this cave for Halloween."
"But I got spooked and ran out here."
"I dropped my torch inside and now I'm too scared to go back in without it."
"Can you get it for me?"
"I dropped my torch in this cave and now I'm too scared to go back in without it."
"Can you get it for me?"
"Wow, you made it back, and you've got my torch!"
"You're a braver Wobbly than I am."
"You can have this, I don't want to wear it anymore."
"Thanks for helping me get my torch."
"I'm building up the courage to go back in."
"Yo dude!"
"Let's play a prank on Kevin."
"He's real afraid of sharks..."
"See what you can come up with. We're always here every day."
"Aaahhhhhh!"
"That was hilarious! Good work."
"You're one cool Wobbly."
"You deserve these cool shades."
"Pranks are the best."
"Hey there."
"The clown hasn't turned up for my daughter's birthday party."
"Do you know where we could find a clown?"
"Finally, a clown!"
"Fantastic!"
"Head inside and get to work."
"Head inside and get to work."
"I think that's enough."
"Did you really have to make so much mess?"
"Oh well, the kids enjoyed it. Thanks."
"The party is downstairs."
"Kids parties sure are hard work."
"This door is locked."
"Are you sure you're a real clown?"
"I just got a strike with my favourite golden bowling ball."
"But it never came back."
"Can you go find it for me?"
"I'm here every day, and I can't practice without it."
"I found this awesome bowling ball at work."
"I've gone to the museum to show it to a friend."
"Oh, I think you're looking for Brian."
"I saw him upstairs with a ball earlier."
"Sorry, I haven't seen anyone come in with a bowling ball."
"Try coming back in the daytime."
"I don't know about any golden ball."
"Do I look like a Brian!"
"Yeah I know Brian."
"He's over there."
"Hey yeah I'm Brian."
"Oh, you want the bowling ball."
"I didn't realise it belonged to anyone."
"Sure, you can have it. To be honest I'm getting kind of tired holding it."
"You found my ball!"
"Now I can get back to practicing."
"With this ball, one day I'll be able to go pro!"
"Thanks for keeping my dream alive."
"You can have this hotdog as a reward."
"One day I'll get a perfect game."
"Expedition Notes - Day 45. "
"I'm beginning to think that this door will only open for gorillas. "
"I wonder if a gorilla costume could fool it?"
"Perhaps the TV studio in the city has one."
"I'll come back to this door later."
"I'm going to concentrate on the mysterious door in the village to the east - Steve."
"I’ve been trying to get onto a show."
"But no one wants an actor who only knows how to play a gorilla."
"I think I'm going to get my old job back at Ice Cream World."
"You want my gorilla outfit?"
"Sure why not."
"I guess I won't be needing it now."
"Now where did I leave my Ice Cream World uniform..."
"Roaarrrr!"
"I King of the Jungle."
"My belly rumbles."
"On hill north from me."

"And banana is very good."
"Me not had banana in long time."
"Wobbly help me fix banana giver."
"And I give you great prize."
"Me too big to do it."
"It built by small monkeys."
"Go through door. Fix banana giver."
"Roaarrrr!"
"Help me fix banana giver."
"And I give you great prize."
"Me too big to do it."
"It built by small monkeys."
"Go through door. Fix banana giver."
"Roaarrrr!"
"There should be wooden cogs on machine."
"Put them back in."
"Then machine work."
"Watch for banana skins, messy monkeys!"
"Bananas!"
"You make good friend."
"Now me have as many bananas as I wants."
"I promised you great prize."
"Me hope you like it."
"Roaarrrr!"
"I’ve heard of secret chamber deep beneath jungle."
"With bananas as big as me."
"One day me pay it a visit."

"I'm going to put it on and go adventuring in the jungle."
"Mum won't stop me this time!"
"Th-th-th-thank you."
"I thought I w-w-w-would be in th-th-there forever!"
"Hey you!"
"I'm Detective Buck, I'm in charge here."
"You've come at a good time."
"I could really use an extra pair of hands."
"I seem to have misplaced my magnifying glass."
"I would find it myself but I've got so much paperwork to do..."
"... and all our other detectives are on holiday."
"I swear I had it when I left the house this morning."
"But I didn't have it with me when I arrived at the station."
"Check the case board for more details."
"As this is police business, you can use the black undercover police car parked outside."
"Good luck Wobbly. I'm.. I mean we are all counting on you."
"This case is to find my missing magnifying glass."
"I had it when I left the house this morning."
"But I didn't have it with me when I arrived at the station."
"Check the case board for more details."
"As this is police business, you can use the black undercover police car parked outside."
"If you can solve this case, we may have more work for you."
"The lost magnifying glass."
"The detective said he had it when he left the house."
"But had lost it when he arrived at the station."
"Makes sense to start looking here."
"Ah, my magnifying glass!"
"Great job!"
"Why don't you fill in for our detectives while they are on holiday?"
"I grant you the rank 'Beginner Detective'."
"You can take my old detective clothes so you look the part."
"Come back here tomorrow for your next briefing."
"I don't have a case for you right now."
"Try coming back tomorrow."
"There are no new cases at the moment."
"Hey Detective, we have a new case for you."
"Cheese has been going missing from the grocery store."
"We need to find out who's responsible."
"I think this case will involve some good old fashioned detective work."
"Check out the case board for more details."
"Don't let me down."
"Find out where the missing cheese is."
"Check out the case board for more details."
"And report back when you find out who's responsible."
"The grocery store where the cheese went missing."
"A picture of the missing cheese."
"The cashier who reported the theft."
"Talking to her would be a good place to start."
"Thank goodness, finally someone has come to help!"
"A giant mouse burst in here, took all our cheese."
"Then ran out the back door."
"It was stuffing cheese into its mouth the whole time. "
"I've never seen anything like it!"
"It ran out the back door."
"Someone's got to stop it!"
"Help!"
"It took all my best cheddar."
"Then charged out the front door!"
"How am I supposed to make macaroni cheese now?"
"A giant mouse took all of our cheese!"
"It was so scary."
"Then it jumped into a car out front and drove off."
"I didn't know that mice could drive!"
"How can one animal need so much cheese?"
"There's been reports of a giant mouse sighting at the Wobbly Mall."
"Go and investigate, Detective."
"I saw it go into that room."
"It had big pointy cheesy teeth!"
"It headed in there. "
"That's where we keep all our cheese."
"Squeak Squeak!"
"Oh you got me..."
"I'm not a real mouse."
"I thought I could get away with it if I was dressed up like one."
"That I could have all the cheese I wanted and no one would mind. "
"But I guess I ended up looking quite scary."
"I'll head to the station and turn myself in."
"But this cheese is just so good."
"I'll head to the station after I've finished this last bit I promise."
"Good work Detective!"
"The suspect turned himself in just before you arrived. "
"We've confiscated his mouse costume."
"And he's promised not to steal cheese anymore."
"So the cheese in Wobbly Island is safe thanks to you!"
"Come back here tomorrow for your next case."
"Report back to the station Detective."
"Another case has just come in, Detective."
"An old lady has lost her cat in Wobbly Village."
"Go see if you can find it."
"Check the case board for more details."
"Off you go Detective."

"Oh please find my little cat!"
"I was just putting down a bowl of her favorite cat food."
"And a seagull flew down and ate it!"
"She got scared and ran off."
"She went that way."
"I think she may have climbed up a tree."
"Please find her."
"You found her!"
"Oh, but she won't come down from the roof now."
"If only we had some more cat food, we might be able to tempt her down."
"They sell it at the mall, why don't you go get some?"
"I'll stay here and make sure she doesn't run away again."
"There must be a way to get her down from there."
"If only we had more cat food, it might tempt her down."
"They sell it at the mall, why don't you go get some?"
"You've got the cat food."
"She's spotted it!"
"It worked!"
"Thank you so much."
"I'm never letting her out of my sight again."
"Another case solved!"
"You're getting the hang of this."
"Come back to the station tomorrow and I should have a new case for you."
"Hey Detective."
"A call has come in from Wobbly Farm."
"Something strange has happened to one of the cows."
"Head over there and see what's going on."
"Check out the case board for more details."
"Solve this case Detective, and you might be in line for a promotion."
"Keep working on the case, Detective."
"Check out the case board for more details."
"Solve this case Detective, and you might be in line for a promotion."
"The call came in from the Farm Island."
"The farmer who called the police."
"A mysterious substance found at the scene."
"The location the incident took place."
"Well I'm sure glad to be seeing you Detective."
"I've got the strangest problem with this here cow."
"I couldn't find Buttercup in the field, so I went out looking for her."
"Then all of a sudden there was a big splash of this pink stuff."
"And there she was, stuck to the side of the barn."
"It was so strange. "
"I'll need your help to get her down."
"I've got some pretty strong cleaning fluid down in my kitchen."
"It helped me clean up after Louie came to visit."
"That might well do the trick."
"I need your help to get her down."
"Bring me the strong cleaning fluid down in my kitchen."
"That might well do the trick."
"You got the cleaning fluid!"
"Let's give it a go."
"..."
"Oh, it doesn't seem to have worked."
"Hmm...."
"Oh yes!"
"You're supposed to mix it with water!"
"There should be a hose nearby."
"Try using that."
"That cleaning fluid isn't working on its own."
"You're supposed to mix it with water!"
"There should be a hose nearby."
"Try using that."
"Woah!"
"That did the trick."
"Old Buttercup looks much happier now."
"Thanks Detective."
"I still don't really understand how she got up there."
"Detective, another incident has just been reported with the same mysterious substance."
"This time it's at the Theme Park."
"Get over there as fast as you can."
"What a mess!"
"It's everywhere."
"I was trying to find my handbag..."
"... and he just showed up, covered everything in jelly, then left!"
"And I still don't have my handbag."
"Can you find it for me?"
"He made ever such a mess."
"I was trying to find my handbag..."
"... and he just showed up, covered everything in jelly, then left!"
"And I still don't have my handbag."
"Can you find it for me?"
"It looks like someone's made footprints in the jelly."
"Would make sense to follow them."
"Ah, you found it."
"Eww it's full of jelly!"
"Thanks...... I guess...."
"It's going to take me hours to clean all this off."
"We've had a confirmed sighting of this jelly vigilante."
"He's on top of one of the skyscrapers in the city."
"Grab the police helicopter from the station and go catch him!"
"It doesn't make any sense."
"I was on the way to the TV studio to play a criminal in a show."
"This guy shows up and says he's going to arrest me."
"Then he covers me in jelly and takes me up here."
"Thanks for getting rid of him."
"Now I just need to free myself from this jelly!"
"This hasn't been my day."
"Great work Detective!"
"Our officers are freeing the stuck Wobbly on the skyscraper as we speak."
"And all our units are on high alert for this 'Jelly Vigilante'."
"He seems to be trying to take the law into his own hands. "
"But with very messy results."
"I think it's time you got a promotion."
"I grant you the rank 'Junior Detective'."
"And as an added perk you can now use the undercover police car whenever you like."
"You'd better have some more up to date detective clothes too."
"You're a credit to the force detective."
"I'm sure we'll have a new case for you soon."
"There isn't anything I can't clean!"
"Hey you're not a scientist..."
"Wait this could be good?"
"They told us we couldn't send any more scientists down there."
"We've been using this Shrinking Machine to try and find the UFO keys."
"They're lost somewhere in the lab."
"We sent a team of scientists to look for them..."
"... but none of them have come back."

"He says his house is haunted."
"Things keep happening on their own."
"Find out what's going on up there!"
"Make sure you read the case board for more details."
"A call came in from the Mountain Village."
"A Wobbly says his house is haunted."
"I want you to go check it out."
"Read the case board for more details."
"The location the call came in from."
"The Wobbly who made the call."
"The "haunted" house."
"Took you long enough!"
"You gotta help me..."
"This house is haunted!"
"Ahh!"
"Things keep happening on their own."
"I need you to find out what's going on."
"Help me please!"
"Things keep happening in here on their own."
"It must be ghosts!"
"I need you to find out what's going on."
"I'm too scared to do it."
"Please put the power back on...."
"You can have them as long as you fix my house!"
"Ah yes they are in a box in the attic."
"I should put them on and examine all the clues again."
"These glasses will allow me to see the clues up close."
"There is a switch for the power in the basement. "
"A group of tiny Wobbly's."
"They must have been messing with all the objects in the house to get our attention."
"Oh no!"
"They must be my colleagues."
"I'm a scientist from up the mountain."
"We do all sorts of top secret tests there."
"These Wobbly's must have got stuck in my lunch box while we were experimenting..."
"and I must have brought them home with me."
"They have been trying to get my attention all this time!"
"They must be my scientist colleagues from up the mountain."
"We do all sorts of top secret tests there."
"These Wobbly's must have got stuck in my lunch box while we were experimenting..."
"and I must have brought them home with me."
"You must take them back up there immediately."
"The staff there will know what to do with them."
"Oh dear."
"Not again... this has happened before."
"Yes hand that lunchbox over to me."
"We'll get those Wobbly's back to a normal size."
"Thanks for bringing them back."
"But make sure you tell no one about this place."
"It's top secret."
"Good job Detective."
"Another successful case."
"We've sent a memo to the mountain base asking them to be more careful in the future."
"You're getting quite good at this."
"Feels like it's time for a nap."
"I still can't believe you found all of the Artifacts!"
"You have ensured that the history of Wobbly Island will be preserved forever."
"How can we ever repay you."
"Looks like the alarm clock isn't here right now."
"I'm sure it'll be back soon."
"What a great idea!"
"I've always wanted to be a car."
"Everything was all muddled here."
"But now everythings back in the right place this door is working again."
"Let's get going!"
"Stop!"
"Don't move any closer."
"If I just mix in this new formula it should work... "
"Fascinating."
"Must make a note to use less electricity next time..."
"But that's fascinating, just fascinating..."
"Oh yes, you, who are you?"
"You want to help our research? Great!"
"We are the 'W.C.C', the Wobbly Climate Club. A group of dedicated weather enthusiasts."
"And you've come at a great time, we're working on a really exciting project right now."
"Our aim is to create a machine that can control the weather!"
"We're getting really close to a working prototype."
"If you want to help head into the room on the left and talk to Colin."
"He deals with volunteers."
"Hi, I'm Colin. I'm in charge of data gathering."
"You want to help out the W.C.C?"
"Then you'll need one of these Data Hat's."
"They allow us to take atmospheric readings to help our research."
"I need you use your Data Hat to take some readings for me."
"Find these 4 locations."
"And use the hat to take a reading."
"The hat will deploy when you are in the right location."
"Come back here once you've taken all 4 readings."
"If you want to help us out you'll need one of these Data Hat's."
"It takes atmospheric readings."
"Find these 4 locations."
"And use the hat to take a reading."
"The hat will deploy when you are in the right location."
"Once you have taken all 4 readings come back here."
"Wow, you actually came back!"
"A lot of volunteers don't. We've lost a lot of Data Hats that way."
"That's some amazing data you've collected. "
"I'll input it into our simulation immediately."
"Let's try it out."
"..."
"Amazing! With all the data you gathered we're nearly ready to test the Weather Machine."
"We just need one more reading."
"But this one may be a bit dangerous to get."
"We need to take a reading inside of a storm..."
"I know it sounds crazy, but we can't make the machine work without this data!"
"Currently there is a storm far out to sea."
"Go visit Anne at "Perfect Parachutes" in Paradise Island."
"We need one more reading before we can test the Weather Machine."
"But this one is a bit dangerous to get."
"We need to take a reading inside of a storm."
"I know it sounds mad, but we need the data!"
"Go visit Anne at "Perfect Parachutes" in Paradise Island."
"She'll get you to the storm. Good luck!"
"You did it!"
"This is exactly what we need."
"I'll just type the storm data into the system..."
"..."
"Yes! It's working."
"Go give it a try."
"How cool was that!"
"Now we can change the weather anytime we want!"
"Any weather you choose will last for a whole day."
"Though there is a catch."
"This time I let you use it for free."
"But from now on it will cost $200 each time you use it."
"Running this equipment isn't cheap you know!"
"Thanks for helping us out though, you're the best!"
"Thanks for helping with the Weather Machine."
"You're welcome to use it whenever you want."
"Or head upstairs if you want to take part in our ongoing weather balloon study."
"I'm impressed! Looks like you've collected some of the readings."
"Come back here and see me once you've got all 4."
"These images show you the locations we still need readings from."
"I didn't think it would actually work!"
"..."
"Fancy making some money?"
"Help us collect research from our weather balloons."
"Welcome to Perfect Parachutes."
"We make falling fun."
"Oh, you're from the Wobbly Climate Club. "
"They sure do love their weather."
"One of our pilots can get you to the storm."
"Just let me know when you want to go."
"She'll get you to the storm. Good luck!"
"Ah, you're finally awake."
"You were incredibly wet when you came in."
"There was seaweed everywhere!"
"But I can't see any lasting damage."
"You're free to go, just perhaps try something less dangerous next time."
"You want to parachute into the storm out to sea?"
"Are you sure? ... Rather you than me. But yeah, one of our pilots can get you there. "
"Just let me know when you want to go."
"It looks like the Weather Machine is working."
"As you've helped us so much, you can be the first to try it!"
"Listen up!"
"We're approaching the jump zone."
"Once we have the storm in our sights, the pilot will fly up over it."
"Then it's down to you to jump inside."
"A rescue crew is underwater ready to recover you."
"Make sure you have that Data Hat thing of yours equipped."
"And don't forget to take the reading once you're inside the storm."
"Any questions?"
"No, good."
"Now take a parachute off the wall and put it on."
"The pilot has spotted a storm growing to the left of the aircraft."
"This is what we've been waiting for."
"In a moment we will begin our ascent and open the rear doors."
"Remember to wait for the green lights before you jump."
"We've missed our chance."
"Time to head back to base."
"We'll have to come back later and try again."
"A true 'W.C.C' legend."
"Remember any weather you choose will last for a whole day."
"I love storms."
"This one's a big'un!"
"At the Wobbly Climate Club we do great science on a small budget."
"I'm working on a formula that turns fog into lightning."
"But at the moment it just explodes."
"You made the Weather Machine work!"
"It's so awesome that we can control the weather."
"I'm going to make it always sunny when I'm on holiday."
"I'm so glad you're here."
"I tried to cut my own hair and..."
"Well... you can see the results. It's a mess!"
"No one is going to want me to cut their hair when I look like this."
"You've got to find me a wig. "
"Maybe you could find one at the the TV Studio?"
"Please hurry!"
"A Wig! Thank you so much."
"That looks much better."
"I've never had blonde hair before."
"Thanks for the wig. It's such an improvement."
"Though it is a bit itchy..."
"Hey could you help me catch some crabs?"
"My friend over there bet I couldn't."
"But every time I try to catch one they go under the sand!"
"If you help me, I'll give you my favourite hat."
"You better use one of these nets."
"What do you say? Help me prove him wrong."
"Help me catch some crabs on the beach."
"My friend over there bet I couldn't."
"I keep trying to catch them but they go under the sand everytime I get close!"
"If you can catch some for me, I'll give you my favourite hat."
"You'll need to use one of these nets, don't worry it doesn't hurt them."
"Wow, you actually caught some crabs."
"That's awesome."
"I think we need a few more to really show him."
"Amazing! You've caught loads of them."
"That'll show him!"
"As promised you can have my hat."
"Thanks dude!"
"You were like a ninja with that net!"
"I didn't see you catch any of those crabs."
"You got this Wobbly to do it for you!"
"Ah man, busted!"
"She can't fool me!"
"She'll never catch any of those crabs."
"There is something wrong with this tap."
"But it is too small to see."
"This TV looks like it has been tampered with."
"But it's too tiny to look at properly."
"These books have fallen off their shelves. This must have been what made the noise."
"But any clues to how they fell are too small to see."
"This bulb just knocked the power out."
"It must have been tampered with, but I can't see anything now with the lights off."
"It looks like something has tampered with the plumbing. "
"And they've even left tiny footprints."
"Something has messed with the wires to make the tv flick on and off."
"There are some tiny dusty footprints on the floor."
"Wait, something has made a tiny ladder on this cable."
"I should head back downstairs and see if the Wobbly can get the power back on."
"Now I have some evidence, I should head back and tell the Wobbly what I have found."
"You say you've found some evidence."
"Tiny ladders.... footprints... what do you mean?"
"Ahhh, it's happening again. Get over there and take a look!"
"Ah! What was that? Somethings upstairs now!"
"I'm going to have to move house aren't I?"
"You must take them back immediately."
"The staff there will know what to do with them."
"Thanks for getting the power back on. Now I can think more clearly."
"You say you're struggling to see the clues?"
"I have a pair of magnifying glasses that can help with that."
"Now where did I put them..."
"I should put on the magnifying glasses so I can see the clues properly."
"Maybe they used it to unscrew the light bulb."
"You can get there through a door around the side of the house."
"Please hurry!"
"You say you're struggling to see the clues?"
"I have a pair of magnifying glasses that can help with that."
"I think they're in the attic."
"Thank for returning my colleagues."
"I really should be more careful..."
"And a ladder on this shelf with more footprints. What does this all mean?"
"Psst! Hey you."
"You look like a light footed Wobbly."
"Meet me in the bank at midnight."
"And I'll let you help me with a little job."
"Don't worry, you won't get into trouble."
"And I'll make it worth your while."
"But don't tell anyone about it!"
"Hey you."
"You look like a light footed Wobbly."
"I think you can help me with a little job."
"Meet me inside this door, here I'll give you a key."
"Great you made it!"
"Did anyone see you come over?"
"No.... good."
"Meet me inside this door, here I'll give you a key."
"Ok, listen up."
"I have a delicate matter I think you can help me with."
"I need you to return this diamond to the bank vault."
"Don't ask any questions!"
"Be careful, there are guards patrolling the corridors. "
"And a lazer security system."
"And look out for any keycards, you'll need them to open the vault."
"Good luck!"
"I have a delicate matter I think you can help with."
"I need you to return this diamond to the bank vault."
"Don't ask any questions!"
"There are guards patrolling the corridors. "
"And a lazer security system."
"And look out for any keycards, you'll need them to open the vault."
"Hey you!"
"You're not supposed to be in here!"
"Stop right there!"
"You're trespassing!"
"Hey!"
"What are you doing in here?"
"You did it!"
"Phew... that's a relief."
"..."
"Ok, I'll explain."
"I stole the diamond from the bank."
"Then I felt really guilty and decided I wanted to put it back."
"But I've been caught stealing before."
"And if I got caught again, I'd be in real trouble!"
"So I got you to put it back instead."
"And a great job you did too. Take this as a reward."
"Thanks little Wobbly."
"I think I'm done with stealing now. "
"I might go see if I can get a job at the mall."
"Meet me in the bank at midnight."
"And I'll let you help me with a little job."
"The investigation should start here."
"Good luck!"
"We have an urgent case Detective."
"And this one is a little... embarrassing."
"Someone has stolen my hat."
"And they've left us a cryptic note."
"It's on the case board. "
"You should take a look."
"And Detective..."
"Please find my hat quickly."
"Someone has stolen my hat."
"And they've left us a cryptic note."
"It's on the case board. "
"You should take a look."
"Detective Buck's missing hat."
"Where it was last seen."
"The cryptic message. It says..."
"<i>“ Water travels round and round, at the top of the green tube the next clue can be found.”</i>"
"So you got one right."
"Well you won't be able to solve this next one!"
"<i>" For the next clue, you might need a hint. It's near bundles of paper, ready to print."</i>"
"You've done better than I thought you would."
"But this last clue is too clever for you."
"<i>" A loop is where the last clue is. Small balls are hit round it, watch them go wizz."</i>"
"I didn't think you'd get this far..."
"So I don't have any more clues."
"But you'll never find me and I'm keeping the hat!"
"..."
"Wait look."
"A receipt from Ice Cream World."
"Perhaps the Wobbly who stole the hat dropped it."
"I should go see if the staff at Ice Cream World have seen anything."
"Welcome to Ice Cream World Detective."
"You're looking for a stolen hat?"
"Now you mention it, I did see a Wobbly in a hat like that."
"He came in and made a big ice cream order."
"It was such as big order he could barely carry it."
"He left only a few minutes ago."
"A trail of footprints, looks like they're made of ice cream."
"They may lead us to the suspect."
"Ahhhhhh!"
"On no! You found me!"
"That wasn't part of the plan."
"But I was so clever!"
"My mum is going to be so mad."
"Here, take the hat back."
"I promise I won't steal anything again."
"Especially now I know you detectives are so clever."
"I'm going to be in so much trouble when mum gets home."
"My hat!"
"Good work!"
"I really appreciate this Detective."
"We've informed the suspects mum about his antics."
"And she's promised us he'll be grounded for a month."
"I don't think he'll be stealing anything for a while!"
"Come back to the station tomorrow for your next case."
"From now on you'll be a Senior Detective."
"I think you're due another promotion."
"The footprints end in this puddle."
"The water must have washed all the ice cream off his feet."
"Maybe a Wobbly around the market saw where he went."
"Oh yes, I saw a Wobbly with a lot of ice cream."
"I've seen him around here a few times."
"I think he lives in the blue apartment on the beach by the bridge."
"It's down that road."
"I haven't seen anyone like that."
"But check out my crazy deals!"
"No can do dude. I didn't see anything."
"Can't you see I'm busy!"
"Make it quick, the Wonderful Wobbly Quiz is on."
"No I don't know who you're talking about."
"Ooh how exciting, a real life detective."
"Oh that sounds like the boy who lives at the end of the hall."
"He is a strange Wobbly."
"Good luck with your investigation."
"This rank gives you access to our new hyper fast police vehicle."
"You've earned it!"
"Looks like there aren't any new cases coming in at the moment."
"We'll be sure to radio you if we get any new ones."
"Thank you for your service Detective."
"Hey!"
"You can't go in there."
"Only qualified sewer engineers are allowed."
"You need to get a Sewer Permit from the Mayor's Office."
"I've told you already."
"You're not allowed in there without a Sewer Permit."
"You can get one from the Mayor's Office."
"What are you doing back here again!"
"Oh I see..."
"You have a Sewer Permit now."
"Well I guess I'll have to let you through."
"Try not to cause any trouble in there."
"Welcome to the Mayor's Office."
"What can I do for you?"
"Oh, you want a Sewer Permit. "
"Well, we don't let just anyone into the sewers."
"It can be dangerous down there."
"So you'll need to pass a test to prove you're up to it."
"If you need to brush up on your sewer knowledge read the Sewer Manual book over there."
"Let me know when you're ready to take the test."
"You're ready to take the test, great!"
"The test is made up of 5 questions."
"And you need to get them all right to pass."
"I'm afraid you got that question wrong."
"Try reading the Sewer Manual to improve your sewer knowledge."
"Come back when you're ready to take the test again."
"Wow, you passed."
"You must have studied really hard!"
"Here's your Sewer Permit and a Sewer Key."
"You can now go into the main sewers at the docks and enter any sewer grates around the island."
"I'm not sure why you'd want to though, it's really dirty down there..."
"Well done for passing the test."
"Take care of your Sewer Permit and Sewer Key."
"They allow you to enter the main sewers at the docks."
"And go into any sewer grates around the island."
"Hey, I haven't seen you around here before."
"I see you have a Sewer Permit."
"You must be a new recruit."
"So let's put your training to use straight away."
"There are 6 broken pipes around the sewers like this one."
"Grab one of these wrenches and use it to fix them."
"I would do it but I'm on a break."
"How are you getting on with fixing those pipes?"
"Oh, you haven't fixed them all yet."
"Well get to it then!"
"Remember to take a wrench with you, and try not to get lost."
"You fixed all the pipes."
"Well, perhaps you did learn something in your training."
"There is one last pipe to fix. "
"It's through that gate in the old sewers."
"I'll unlock the gate for you."
"Have you fixed that last pipe yet?"
"It's through that gate in the old sewers."
"I went in there and fixed that pipe myself."
"Do you think I just stand around here all day!"
"Ah finally!"
"A Wobbly."
"I've waited so long for someone to come down here."
"I am the Queen of the Sewers. "
"And you must help me with an important task."
"My water taps have all run dry."
"I need a constant supply of water to keep my tadpoles happy."
"I was going to ask Louie for help, but he's so busy with all that toxic waste."
"So you'll have to do..."
"Take this Old Sewers Key."
"Use it to unlock the 4 Old Sewer grates around Wobbly Island."
"You can recognize an Old Sewer grate by my royal crest."
"Find a way to turn the water back on in each of these sewers."
"They are in 4 locations. The City, the Village, the Mountain and Paradise Island."
"What? You've forgotten what you need to do already."
"This is why you should never get a Wobbly to do a frog's job."
"You must find a way to turn the water back on in each of the 4 Old Sewers."
"You can recognize an Old Sewer grate by my royal crest."
"They can be found in the City, the Village, the Mountain and Paradise Island."
"It is of the utmost importance that they work again."
"Now go, you can get back to the upper sewers through there."
"You've fixed some of my water taps. I thank you."
"But the job is not done yet."
"All the 4 old sewers must be repaired."
"Remember they can be found in the City, the Village, the Mountain and Paradise Island."
"So get to it, young Wobbly."
"You've done it!"
"Maybe Wobblys aren't so bad after all."
"Is good to see my home back to its watery best."
"... but I haven't been entirely honest with you."
"There is another reason I got you to turn the taps back on."
"You see my crown has been stolen!"
"It got grabbed by one of those pesky tentacles into that room over there."
"And I cannot get it back myself. I feel so lost without it."
"But now the water taps are flowing again you should be able to get it for me."
"I will give you a gift worthy of your efforts if you can return it."
"Please do this one last task for me."
"Fetch my crown for me."
"It got grabbed by a tentacle into that room over there."
"But now the water taps are flowing again you should be able to get it for me."
"I will give you a gift worthy of your efforts if you can return it."
"My crown!"
"I feel complete again."
"Thank you young Wobbly. You've proved so very useful."
"Now I can get back to looking after my tadpoles."
"As I promised, here is your reward."
"It's a little friend of mine. He'll help you out with your jumping."
"And you will always be welcome here."
"Now begone, I have things to do."
"Life down here is so much better now the water is flowing again."
"Everything is just that little bit wetter."
"You have my thanks young Wobbly."
"Your Sewer Key doesn't unlock this grate."
"As I said before."
"You can't go in there without a permit from the Mayor's Office."
"Yes, that's correct."
"That's the right answer."
"Correct, you have been studying."
"Yes that's right. Now for the last question."
"What's this..."
"It looks like part of a map."
"Belonging to a Wobbly called "Basil the Bard"."
"According to the map he was a great musician who lived over 250 years ago."
"And this map shows the location of his buried treasure!"
"If I can search other sewers for the other map parts maybe I could find his treasure."
"Another part of Basil the Bards map!"
"This one has some lyrics scribbled on it for a song called "All I need is cheese"."
"Another map section!"
"It has some unintelligible doodling on it."
"A new piece of the Bard's map!"
"There are some nasty looking stains on it."
"Another map piece!"
"That's more than half of it complete now."
"A new map part!"
"It has a few holes in it."
"A new map piece!"
"This one has song titles on it, like "The Ballad of Wobbling" and "The Wobbly Shuffle"."
"Another part of Basil the Bards map!"
"Only one piece left to find now."
"The last piece of Basil the Bards treasure map!"
"There is a cross on it, this must be where the treasure is buried!"
"I should study the map in my To Do List."
"And bring a metal detector with me once I've worked out where to look."
"Basil the Bards treasure!"
"It's full of his clothes and some sheet music."
"And a large pile of gold!"
"This artifact was lost in the sewers on Paradise Island."
"This artifact was lost in the sewers near the farm."
"This artifact was lost in the sewers on the mountain."
"This artifact was lost in the sewers at the docks."
"A toilet made of gold. Isn't it shiny."
"A giant lipstick found in the sewers. No one is sure who used it."
"Blueprints of the original Wobbly Island sewer."
"One of Louie's baby teeth. It's enormous."
"Don't enter a Queen's sewer without her permission."
"Get back to fixing my water taps."
"..."
"If I connect this part to this shiny bit. Yes... yes....."
"Huh!"
"Oh hello! Sorry you startled me."
"Welcome to my little camp."
"I see you noticed my latest project. What do you think?"
"It's impressive isn't it."
"I've been camping out here studying that rocket so I could build my own one."
"It can't be that hard!"
"I only need a few more parts to get it working..."
"In fact. Perhaps you can help me."
"I need the following bits."
"A fuse. There should be some at the Wobbly Power Plant."
"Uranium ore. You'll have to go to the Wobbly Mines for this."
"A big piece of metal. A large bin from the city should do."
"And finally a small heavy bit of metal. A set of barbells would be perfect."
"A fuse, brilliant! Now I can finish off the wiring."
"Uranium ore! This will help power the rocket."
"Great! A bin. This will make the shell of the rocket."
"You found some barbells! This metal will be perfect for the engines."
"That's everything I need."
"Now I'll get to work! We'll be blasting off in no time."
"Come back tomorrow and I should have it ready."
"I'm still working on it."
"Come back tomorrow."
"Isn't it marvellous!"
"Though perhaps a bit smaller than I was planning."
"I think we're ready to test it."
"How about you do it, as you did so much of the work."
"Give that button a press."
"Incredible! That's the most excitement I've had in years."
"And I couldn't have done it without your help."
"I haven't forgotten your reward! "
"I had some material left over so I've made a version of the rocket you can wear."
"I thought you might find it fun."
"You have to wear all three parts of it at once for it to work though. "
"I'm pretty sure it'll work..."
"Anyway, now I'll have a think about my next project."
"Maybe next time I should add cheese to the rocket fuel...."
"I need 4 parts to complete this rocket remember."
"A fuse. There should be some at the Wobbly Power Plant."
"Uranium ore. You'll have to go to the Wobbly Mines for this."
"A big piece of metal. A large bin from the city should do."
"And finally a small heavy bit of metal. A set of barbells would be perfect."
"If you can get that all for me then I'll make you something extra special as a reward."
"I think we're ready to test the rocket."
"How about you do it, as you did so much of the work."
"Give that button a press."
"Keep off there!"
"It's probably still hot from the launch."
"That is all you need to know."
"Now go, you can get back to the upper sewers through there."
"If you can get that all for me then I'll make you something extra special as a reward."
"Great! That's the last artifact in the Sewer Collection."
"I never thought we'd see those again!"
"Hey!"
"How did you get down here?"
"It took me ages to prise that sewer grate open."
"I've been sent here to fix a plumbing problem."
"Everytime we clean it up, a few weeks later it just gets clogged up again!"
"When you get in there you'll see what I mean."
"I just want to know where it is all coming from."
"Blarb Womba Dob Dob"
"Blop Blabo!"
"Dum Wubba Bobo Blarb"
"I broke tribe leaders best vase!"
"Hidden broken parts down here so no one find them."
"Been trying to stick them together with glue but not working. Big mess."
"Hey there. Welcome welcome!"
"Nice to see I'm not the only Wobbly who likes exploring the sewers."
"In fact, I have someone I'd like to introduce you to."
"Meet Wiggly, my tentacle friend."
"We were just having a chat about Louie."
"You know, the monster who eats all the toxic waste from the Power Plant."
"Louie isn't happy with the flavour of the toxic waste."
"Wiggly told me Louie wants to add some ingredients to the waste to make it taste better."
"Hey good idea Wiggly. Maybe you could help?"
"Wiggly drew some pictures on the wall to show us. He's a great artist you know."
"Louie wants a cup of coffee, a shopping trolley and a tub of ice cream added in."
"They'll need to be thrown into the giant vats inside the Power Plant."
"Wiggly here would like you to help Louie out."
"He wants you to add some ingredients to the toxic waste in the Power Plant."
"Louie wants a cup of coffee, a shopping trolley and a tub of ice cream added in."
"He says it'll make it taste better."
"They'll need to be thrown into the giant vats inside the Power Plant."
"Wiggly will be so happy if you can do it!"
"That's the last ingredient. I should head back to the sewer and tell them it's done."
"You did it!"
"Wiggly says Louie is very happy with the new flavour."
"You've made one big monster very happy."
"Wiggly will be so happy if you can do it!"
"Ahh. Yes.. yes.."
"The little Wobbly from the yellow house in the village..."
"... has finally come to visit me."
"Welcome to my humble little tent."
"Come over here to look at my wares."
"I sell all kinds of trinkets and potions."
"Goodbye little Wobbly ... don't forget to visit!"
"Right, time to send you on your way."
"I hope it will help you on your adventures around Wobbly Island."
"But you deserve it more than I do!"
"I can't believe you found all my presents."
"It makes me so happy that someone went to all the effort to find them."
"And such a magnificent achievement requires an equally magnificent reward."
"How about my magic cape?"
"I had been using it to pop to the shops."
"Come, take a seat."
"I'm sure my crystal ball will present you with what you seek."
"Wow, that's the last item we need for the Wizard Collection!"
"You know it's odd, I never even remember creating this collection."
"This artifact has been magically hidden on the mountain. It will need a potion to reveal it."
"This artifact has been magically hidden in a tunnel. It will need a potion to reveal it."
"This artifact has been magically hidden in the docks. It will need a potion to reveal it."
"This artifact has been magically hidden in the forest. It will need a potion to reveal it."
"A shabby Wizards robe. It has many patches on it."
"A shabby Wizards hat, it looks like something's taken a bite out of it."
"A wizard's staff. Doesn't it look magical."
"A wizard's spellbook. It's full of unreadable incantations."
"Or inside I can read my crystal ball for you."
"Oh I know!"
"I found this key when I was cleaning up for the grand opening."
"I think it opens the Museum basement door over there."
"Take a look down there and you can have anything you want."
"I'm sure there'll be something interesting to find."
"You've earned it."
"Wait a minute..."
"Can it be..."
"Yes!"
"That's the last Artifact we need."
"That means..."
"The Museum is complete!"
"Well done! Getting all those Artifacts must have been difficult. "
"I've been preparing for this moment for a long time, there is so much to do!"
"We must have a grand opening ceremony as soon as possible."
"I'll call the Mayor."
"We've had loads of visitors since the grand opening."
"It's nice to see so many Wobbly's taking their history seriously."
"Louie made such a mess though."
"A prototype multi-terrain vehicle."
"Invented by an eccentric Wobbly called "Otto the Tinkerer"."
"It wasn't deemed safe enough for use on the roads of Wobbly Island and so was donated to the Museum."
"Would you like me to read my crystal ball for you?"
"Looks like you haven't found what you are looking for yet."
"Would you like to see it again? Or if you like I can find you something new."
