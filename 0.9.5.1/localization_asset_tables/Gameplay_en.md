Buried the spare basement key in the garden today, 
it should be safe there. 

I'll need to use a metal detector from the Treasure Hunters if I want to dig it back up."

I think those Wobblys up in the mountain have been watching me. 

Luckily they still have no idea what I'm really up too. "

        <size=60>Sewering 101</size>


This training book will give you all the information you need to safely navigate the Wobbly Island Sewers."
"
3. 
 
Lesson 1: Moving Around Safely 
 
The sewers can be a dangerous place. You must be careful of hazards such as low hanging pipes and slippery ground. There have even been reports of tentacles emerging from pipes in some sewers.
 
If you see such a danger you must move around it carefully and carry on with your work."
"
5. 
 
Lesson 2: Getting Lost 
 
Sometimes it's easy to get lost in the sewers. Many pipes look identical and it can be difficult to find your way around. 
 
If you do get lost, go to the nearest <b>Exit Pipe</b> and jump in. This will always take you to the main sewer exit."
"
7. 
 
 Lesson 3: Repairing The Sewers
 
From time to time you may come across a pipe with a hole in it. Broken pipes like these need to be fixed as soon as possible. 
 
Grab a nearby <b>Wrench</b> and fix broken pipes whenever you see them."
"

Lesson 4: Sewers Are Complicated

No one exactly knows how the sewers in Wobbly Island work. All the schematics were lost a long time ago. 

So if you see any valves, buttons or mechanisms that you do not understand, please don't touch them."
"
11. 
 
 Lesson 5: Respect The Sewers
 
Having access to the Wobbly Island Sewers is a privilege, and not every Wobbly can be trusted with it. 
 
Never let anyone else use your permits or sewer keys."
