# "Space Mission Dialog_en"

```"Ah my favourite Cadet."
"I've got your next mission, and it's a strange one. But I think you can handle it."
"We started receiving a mysterious signal from inside this asteroid a few weeks ago."
"When we dug into the asteroid we found this Obelisk."
"None of our researchers out there have managed to find out anything about it."
"Go there and see if you can do any better."
"I'll let the cadets out there know you're coming."
"Those are your orders. Get to it Cadet."
"You have your orders Cadet."
"I need you to visit the mysterious Obelisk we found. Follow the marker on your map."
"You must be the new Cadet, the Captain said you were coming."
"Isn't it amazing! Crazy that it was hidden in this asteroid the whole time."
"But we have been here ages now, and haven't learnt a thing about it."
"We've poked, prodded, stepped on and jumped on every bit of it."
"But nothing happens. "
"It would be great if you can help."
"It's beginning to make us look bad..."
"Hey! You're not allowed here."
"Only Wobbly's on official Space Cadet business can come here."
"Hey cadet."
"Something just happened to the signal."
"Come back to the Command Bridge immediately."
"That is all Cadet."
"So make sure you report in regularly."
"The Captain wants us to work out what this thing is."
"We've been here ages and we haven't got anywhere."
"We need to make some progress soon."
"Or the Captain will be on all our backs!"
"How did you do that?"
"Oh and look it gave you something. "
"I wonder what it does."
"I wonder what that thing does."
"Woah!"
"That's weird."
"Hey Cadet."
"Something just happened to the signal."
"Come back to the Command Bridge immediately."
"You sure are clever."
"Welcome back Cadet."
"What you did on that asteroid created another mysterious signal."
"It's coming from a completely different point in the sector."
"Also interestingly, when you placed that item, it activated that part of the Obelisk."
"We think what you found is part of a key."
"If we can find the other key parts we might be able to activate the whole thing."
"As you've proved so capable, I'm going to let you lead the charge on this."
"I'll mark the new signal location on your map."
"Head over there and see what you can find."
"Go to the signal I have shown on your map."
"See if you can find more of these key parts."
"Another key part."
"You should put that into the next slot on the Obelisk."
"We've just received another mysterious signal."
"It began transmitting the same time you placed that key part."
"I've marked it's location on your map."
"Excellent work Cadet."
"We'll have all the key parts in no time."
"As predicted the signal has changed again."
"This time it is near the Mining Asteroid."
"It should be the last key part if our theory is correct."
"Get over there Cadet."
"The last key part!"
"Take it to the Obelisk immediately."
"And be careful. We don't know what will happen when you activate it."
"Our sensors are going crazy!"
"What's happening over there?"
"Cadet... report in!"
"We've lost your signal..."
"Are you there Cadet..."
"Congratulations. I'm sure we'll have some more missions for your soon."
"Hey, who are you?"
"Another Wobbly who wants to be a Space Cadet."
"And why wouldn't you, we are a great organisation."
"Welcome to the Space Station Command Bridge. Isn't it impressive."
"I'm Captain Aurora. And together with all my Space Cadets we run this whole station."
"Unfortunately we currently don't need any new recruits right now."
"Excuse me Captain. "
"Yes Cadet Brown?"
"I've just come from a meeting with the Mining Boss."
"He left his lunch behind, and you know how he gets when he's hungry!"
"Yes, we should get it back to him immediately."
"In fact... perhaps you can help us out."
"You could go to the Mining Asteroid and give the Mining Boss his lunch."
"Talk to Cadet Brown about your task."
"I have more important things to be doing."
"Here is the lunch the Mining Boss left behind."
"I'd get it to him quickly if I were you."
"He should be in his control room on the Mining Asteroid."
"I'll mark it on your map."
"Report back here once you've delivered it."
"I'm so hungry! "
"Where is my lunch?"
"I don't know boss."
"Wait this Wobbly over here has it."
"Give it here!"
"Nom nom nom nom."
"That's better. Though it was really dry!"
"How about you fetch me a milkshake to wash it down?"
"They sell them down at the Mine Canteen."
"Good work with the Mining Boss."
"He can be a tricky Wobbly and the last thing we need is problems with the miners."
"You've shown potential. Enough to earn you a position in the Space Cadets."
"See if you can make anything of it."
"Report back if you find something."
"If I go down there they'll ask me about their wages again."
"Here is the money for it."
"This is a good chance to prove if you have what it takes to be a Space Cadet."
"Go on, be a good Wobbly."
"Get me a milkshake."
"They sell them down at the Mine Canteen."
"That pastry was so dry!"
"Thank you Wobbly, I needed that."
"All this mining business is thirsty work."
"I'm looking for Wobbly's like you to work in our mines."
"So come talk to me if you want to earn some real cash."
"Anyway, I've got things to do. Give my regards to Captain Aurora."
"Make sure you take the Cadet Spaceship so you can transport the key parts."
"Good luck Cadet."
"See Cadet Brown for more details, and let me know if you're successful. Goodbye Wobbly."
"I'm so hungry! "
"Do you have my lunch?"
"No, then leave me alone then."
"Well done lifeform."
"I told you they would do it."
"No you didn't."
"Yes I did! And now you owe me a Wobbly Pizza."
"Stop it both of you."
"Anyway..."
"You've proven yourself to be a reasonably intelligent being."
"We had hoped you'd be less intelligent. "
"But to pass our tests takes at least a tenth of our intellect."
"And as such you've earned this gift from our kind."
"We hope you will find it ... elevating."
"Oh well, off to the next galaxy I guess."
"To find a new lifeform to do tests on."
"Goodbye Wobbly."
"Cadet! There you are."
"What happened up there?"
"..."
"Okay ..."
"You met aliens who were testing your intelligence."
"And they spoke to you about Wobbly Pizza."
"How strange."
"When our researchers went in after you they didn't find any aliens."
"Just a series of doors which which we can't get through."
"I think that Obelisk might have scrambled your memories a bit."
"Either way you did a great job out there."
"You are a credit to the Space Cadets."
"The sector is quiet at the moment."
"I don't have any Space Cadet work for you."
"Finally! We've restablished your comms signal."
"You had us worried there cadet!"
"Come back to the Space Station to report your findings."
"I'm not going in there. It looks dangerous!"
"Cadet, the Captain has a new mission for you."
"Please report to the Command Bridge."
"Welcome back Cadet."
"I have a new mission for you."
"Take a look at this."
"A Wobbly Class Starfinder frigate crashed in a field of dark asteroids a few weeks ago."
"The pilot says he couldn't see them."
"Though a half eaten sandwich found in the bridge suggests he was distracted."
"Lucky no one was hurt, but the damage was severe."
"The Starfinder's engine core was damaged in the crash."
"It's becoming unstable so we need to remove it as soon as possible."
"This is where you come in."
"Retrieve the core and bring it back to the station so it can be destroyed."
"Your first step is to head over to the Cargo Bay in the mall. "
"The Cadets down there will tell you what you need to know about the ship."
"Oh and Cadet..."
"Take this comms pack so I can talk to you while you're out in space."
"You have your orders now, no time to waste."
"Get down to the Cargo Bay."
"The cadets down there will tell you how to retrieve the engine core from Starfinder."
"Off you go then!"
"Oh hello!"
"Welcome to the Cargo Bay."
"Captain Aurora said I'm to give you a briefing for your mission."
"So let's get straight to it then."
"This is the layout of a Starfinder ship."
"Here we have the dock, this is where you'll need to enter the ship."
"From there you'll have to travel down to the engine room at the lower deck."
"That's down here."
"This is where engine core will be."
"Once you're in there remove the core, load it into your ship and bring it back here."
"Try to be careful, it will be quite unstable."
"FInally, put the core into this anti-matter box. "
"Then press this button to destroy it."
"Simple really."
"You'll need to take a spaceship that can hold cargo."
"I recommend taking one of the Space Cadet ships."
"There should be one parked on the landing pads through that door."
"Oh I almost forgot... take this keycard."
"It should get you through any doors on the ship that are still working."
"That's everything. Good luck Cadet, try not to blow us all up."
"Oh, you're back!"
"You want a reminder of your mission?"
"Ok, you need to recover the unstable engine core from a crashed Starfinder frigate."
"This is the ships layout."
"You'll need to land here in the dock."
"And make your way down here to the engine room."
"Remove the engine core here and bring it back."
"Put it in this anti-matter box to destroy it."
"Now off you go, we can't leave that core too long!"
"Cadet, you made it onto the ship. Well done."
"Try and look for a way out of the dock."
"Looks like this lift is broken, you'll have to find another way down."
"This door still has power."
"Try your keycard to see if you can get through."
"Great, you're in. Now look for a way to get down to the floor below."
"Looks like this way leads back up to the top floor."
"We need to find a way to the floor below."
"A Wobbly!"
"I haven't seen a Wobbly in a while."
"Oh! Would you like a coffee?"
"My programming says that you will like it."
"Here you go."
"..."
"Well perhaps you can drink it later."
"I'm so happy to have a Wobbly I can make coffee for. "
"I have been wondering where everyone went."
"They must be really sad without any coffee."
"Let me know if you want another one."
"Here's another coffee."
"A great way to start your morning."
"... at least I think it's morning."
"Cadet, the engine room is one more level down."
"You might need to find another air vent to help you get there."
"There should a vent in one of these rooms."
"Oh that doors locked."
"I tried to see if anyone in there might want coffee."
"But my keycard wouldn't work."
"As I'm just a coffee robot I do not know how to open it."
"Find a way to get the door working Cadet."
"Take a look around and see what you can find."
"Initailizing... "
"Commencing robot mode: Captains Assistant."
"..."
"Initialization complete."
"Good morning, you must be the Captain."
"How can I be of service."
"You want to go through that door?"
"Of course Captain. Let me perform a system scan of the ship."
"..."
"Oh dear, this ship is in a very poor condition."
"That door isn't working because it is low on power."
"Let me re-route some from another level."
"..."
"The door should be operational now."
"Leave me to it Captain. I'll try and fix some of the ships other faults."
"Captain, I'm sure you've noticed this already."
"The ship is a bit of a mess."
"To be honest it's embarrassing to be a Captains Assistant on such a ship."
"Especially in here, there is coffee everywhere."
"I'm trying to fix what I can but we should call the maintanence crew immediately."
"There's the air vent!"
"Good thinking with reprogramming the robot."
"Hurry there is no time to waste."
"Great! You've made it to the engine room."
"Ahead of you should be the core. "
"The controls to release it should be on the platform above."
"These levers release the engine core."
"But it looks like the manual is missing."
"You'll need to find it so you know the correct sequence."
"Good work!"
"Now we need to get the core back up to your ship."
"Let's see if we can fix the engine room lift."
"That's the most direct way."
"Well done."
"All that's left to do it transport it back to the Cargo Bay."
"But Cadet..."
"Be careful with it."
"The engine core!"
"Quick, put it in the anti-matter box and destroy it."
"Great job Cadet."
"Please report back to the Command Bridge."
"That was an excellent job you did there Cadet."
"I knew I could count on you."
"It's nice to know that shipwreck won't be exploding anytime soon."
"You know what?"
"I think it's about time you had your own Space Cadet ship."
"We designed them to be fast and sturdy, and to carry a reasonable sized cargo."
"I'm sure you'll find it useful on your travels."
"I'll let you know when I have another mission for you."
"You are dismissed."
